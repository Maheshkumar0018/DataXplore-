# DataXplore-
The application provides a user-friendly interface for conducting basic exploratory analysis on submitted files. It consists of two modules: Exploratory Analysis and Visualization. 

In the Exploratory Analysis module, users can gain valuable insights into their data by accessing various features. They can view the shape of the DataFrame, which provides information on the number of rows and columns in the dataset. The df dtypes functionality allows users to explore the data types of each column, helping them understand the nature of the variables present. The df distribution feature enables users to analyze the distribution of values within the DataFrame, aiding in identifying patterns or outliers. Additionally, users can examine the presence of null values in the dataset using the df nulls feature, allowing for effective data cleaning and handling of missing data.

In the Visualization module, users can generate a variety of plots to visually represent their data. This module offers different visualization options, allowing users to choose the most suitable plot type for their data. By visualizing the data, users can uncover relationships, trends, or patterns that may not be apparent from the raw data alone. This functionality enhances data exploration and supports data-driven decision making.

Overall, the application empowers users to perform exploratory analysis and visualization tasks efficiently, enabling them to gain a comprehensive understanding of their data and derive meaningful insights.
